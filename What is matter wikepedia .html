      <h2>What is Matter?</h2>
      <p>
        Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.
        Everything around us, including air, water, and solids, is made of matter.
      </p>
 

      <h2>States of Matter</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Solid</b></li>
        <li><b>Liquid</b></li>
        <li><b>Gas</b></li>
        <li><b>Plasma</b></li>
        <li><b>Bose-Einstein Condensate</b></li>
        <li><b>Super Solid</b></li>

      <h2>Properties of Matter</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mass</li>
        <li>Volume</li>
        <li>Density</li>
        <li>Flowability</li> 
     </ul>
  
  </main>

<h2><b>Gas</b></h2>
<p>Gas is one of the fundamental states, it is a form of matter which don't have a fixed shape, it has very high density, it is compressable, it is formed under a high temprature but most of the gases like oxygen and hydrogen etc. form on low teprature. It is a fluid. Its properties are:-</p>
<ol>
   <li>It don't have a fixed shape</li>
   <li>It has high density</li>
   <li>It is compressable</li>
   <li>It is a fluid, it can flow in any direction</li>
   <li>It's intermolecular space is very high</li>
   <li>It applies force in evry direction</li>
   <li>It form in high temprature but most of the gases like oxygen and hydrogen etc. form on low temprature</li>
</ol>

<h2><b>Liquid</b></h2>
<p>Liquid is one of the fundamental states, it is a form of matter which don't have a fixed shape, high density, and it is almost impossible to compress, it is formed under a high temprature, It can also form by compressing gas to its limits. It is a fluid. Its properties are:-</p>

<ol>
   <li>It don't have a fixed shape</li>
   <li>It has high density</li>
   <li>It is almost impossible to compress</li>
   <li>It usually form on high temprature</li>
   <li>It's intermolecular space is low</li>
   <li>It is a fluid, it can flow in any direction besides upwards</li>
   <li>It takes the shape of container in which it is placed</li>
   <li>It applies force in sideways and downways direction</li>
</ol>

<h2>Solid</h2>
<p>Solid is one of the fundamental states, it is a form of matter which has a fixed shape, low density, and it is incompressable, it is fromed under a low temprature, almost evrything around us is solid. Its properties are:-</p>

<ol>
   <li>It has a fixed shape</li>
   <li>It has low density</li>   
   <li>It is incompressable</li>
   <li>It usually form in low temprature</li>
   <li>It's intermolecular space is very low</li>
   <li>It's molecules vibrate on it's own place</li>
   <li>It's melting point is usually very high</li>
   <li>The kinetic energy between its molecules is very low</li>
   <li>It applies force in downwards direction</li>
</ol>

<h2><b>Plasma</b></h2>
<p>Plasma is one of the fundamental states, it is a form of matter which don't have a fixed shape and volume, it is highly conductive and reactive to electromagnetic fields, it is formed in extreme temprature by heating gas, it is made up of ionized particles. It is the most abandoned state of matter in space. Its properties are:-

<ol>
   <li>Plasma contains ionized particles but still it is neutral</li>
   <li>Plasma don't have definite shape and volume</li>
   <li>Plasma only exists at high temprature</li>
   <li>Particals of plasma react from high distance which make them travel accross in groups</li>
</ol>

<h2>Bose-Einstein Condensate</h2>
<p>A Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) is a fifth state of matter formed when bosons (e.g., rubidium atoms) are cooled to temperatures near absolute zero (-273.15). At this ultra-cold limit, individual atoms lose their identity and merge into a single, collective "super-atom" wave, exhibiting quantum phenomena on a macroscopic scale</p>


<h2>Super solid</h2>
<p>A supersolid forms when quantum particles (typically atoms or light-matter particles called polaritons) are cooled to temperatures near absolute zero, causing them to simultaneously condense into an ordered, rigid crystal structure and act as a superfluid with zero viscosity .A supersolid is an exotic, quantum state of matter that simultaneously behaves as a rigid, ordered crystal and a frictionless, superfluid liquid.It combines crystalline structure (fixed, periodic atom arrangement) with superfluidity (atoms moving without energy loss or friction).Unlike normal solids, a supersolid can change its density and flow; unlike normal liquids, it maintains its crystalline internal structure.It is a manifestation of quantum mechanics where particles exist in a highly correlated state at extremely low temperatures.

<h2>Super fluid</h2>
<p>A superfluid is a state of matter—typically liquid helium cooled to near absolute zero (-273.15)—characterized by zero viscosity and zero friction. It flows without losing energy, can climb up container walls, and passes through microscopic pores, enabling it to leak out of sealed containers. Unlike normal fluids, superfluids have no internal friction, allowing them to flow indefinitely without losing kinetic energy.</p>
